## Fuel Station Management Web App

This project is an interactive web application built using a REST API, developed for the course "Electronic Business" at the University of Thessaly. The app is designed to display fuel station data and manage orders.

Key features include:

- Google Maps integration to display fuel stations and their prices.
- User roles: station owners and consumers.
- Station owners can manage fuel prices and orders after login.
- Consumers can view stations, and place or delete fuel orders.
- AJAX calls to fetch and update data from the REST API.
- REST API supports CRUD operations with endpoints for stations, prices, orders, and user login.
- Data is provided in JSON and XML formats.

The backend uses the Slim PHP framework, and JWT-based authentication is implemented for secure login.
